## Agenda / Notes

- Discussion of user stories
  - [#124](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS_TC/issues/124)
  - Major themes/topics
    - A variety of requirements from different users
    - Broadly can categorize by types of users. Individual scientists, mission pipelines, mission analysts, etc.
    - Missions
      - Primarily need stability and reliability
      - Ocassional bug fixes
      - Early vs mature/later missions
        - Early mission still need rapid feature iteration
        - Pre-launch missions vs 10+ year old missions
      - Missions have to "freeze" software at certain points
        - Most missions are between 3.4 and 3.10
      - Trouble keeping up with continuously changing software
    - Individual scientists/analysts
      - More interested in getting critical bug fixes/features that are needed to complete tasks
      - Less interested in stability
    - Conflicting requirements between missions and individuals
      - Rapid iterations vs stable development
    - Issues with old releases breaking things
      - Changes in processing outputs between versions that were unexpected
      - Missions are doing significant validation work
      - ISIS development has limited validation
  - Release styles of other software packages
    - Python
      - Very long deprecation windows, years
      - NAIF, very slow release schedule focused on stability

  - Data versioning
    - Need updated kernels & calibration data to process new data
      - Some missions manage their own kernels and don't use the standard ISIS data area
    - There is the potential for updating kernels breaking old software versions
      - E.G. modifying the sequence of frames in the camera <-> Body rotation
      - Updating the IAK

- Major topics
  - Validation
  - Data Versioning
  - Need for both a stable release and a rapid release

## Next Meeting

- TBD based on larger TC discussion
